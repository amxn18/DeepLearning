# CNN with SVM as Final Layer on Dogs vs Cats Dataset 

## Code Explanation

- **Data Setup & Augmentation**  
  - Dataset is downloaded and organized into training and test folders.  
  - `ImageDataGenerator` is used to preprocess images by rescaling and applying augmentations like shear, zoom, and horizontal flip to enrich the training data.

- **Custom Generator for Labels**  
  - A wrapper generator converts binary labels from {0,1} to {-1,+1} to fit the SVM hinge loss requirements.

- **CNN Model Architecture**  
  - Two convolutional layers (`Conv2D`) with ReLU activations and strides for downsampling.  
  - MaxPooling layers (`MaxPool2D`) reduce spatial dimensions further.  
  - Flatten layer converts 2D feature maps to 1D feature vectors.  
  - Dense layer with ReLU activation to learn complex features.  
  - Final Dense layer uses **linear activation** instead of sigmoid or softmax, to produce raw scores compatible with SVM hinge loss.

- **Compilation & Training**  
  - Model is compiled with **hinge loss**, which is standard for SVM classifiers, instead of usual binary crossentropy.  
  - Adam optimizer and accuracy metric are used.  
  - The training uses the custom label generator feeding labels as -1 or +1.

- **Multiclass Classification**  
  - For multiclass, the final Dense layer changes to number of classes with **softmax activation**.  
  - The loss changes to **squared hinge loss**, a variant of hinge loss suitable for multiclass SVM.

- **Prediction & Evaluation**  
  - Model predicts on new images, output interpreted by thresholding raw scores for class assignment.

## Understanding CNN

- CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) is a deep learning architecture primarily used for image data.  
- It uses convolutional layers to automatically learn spatial hierarchies of features.  
- Pooling layers reduce dimensionality and help generalize by summarizing feature regions.  
- Fully connected (Dense) layers perform classification based on extracted features.

## Why Use Linear Activation + Hinge Loss?

- Typical CNN classifiers end with sigmoid (binary) or softmax (multiclass) activations combined with crossentropy loss.  
- Using **linear activation** means the final layer outputs raw decision scores instead of probabilities.  
- The **hinge loss** is the loss function used in Support Vector Machines (SVMs) which tries to maximize the margin between classes.  
- This combination allows CNN to act as a **feature extractor**, while the last layer acts like an SVM classifier, benefiting from margin-based classification.

## Multiclass Case: Softmax + Squared Hinge Loss

- For more than two classes, the model uses softmax activation to output probability distributions over classes.  
- Squared hinge loss is used instead of hinge loss, providing smoother gradients and better convergence for multiclass SVM.  
- This allows margin maximization in a multiclass setting.

## How is this Used in RCNN?

- RCNN (Region-based CNN) is an object detection framework.  
- It first proposes regions of interest (candidate object boxes).  
- For each proposed region, CNN extracts features.  
- Instead of just using softmax classifiers, RCNN originally used **SVMs** on these CNN features to classify each region into object classes or background.  
- This leverages the margin-based classification strengths of SVM combined with CNN‚Äôs powerful feature extraction.

## RCNN for Object Detection - Overview

- Step 1: Generate candidate object regions using selective search.  
- Step 2: Warp each region to fixed size and pass through CNN to extract features.  
- Step 3: Train SVM classifiers on extracted features to classify objects in each region.  
- Step 4: Use bounding box regression for precise localization.  
- This pipeline separates feature extraction (CNN) and classification (SVM), improving detection accuracy.

## Summary

- Combining CNN with SVM final layers allows leveraging strong feature extraction of CNN with margin-maximizing classifiers.  
- This approach is particularly useful in object detection frameworks like RCNN.  
- Using hinge loss and linear activation in CNN's last layer facilitates this integration.  
- For multiclass problems, softmax + squared hinge loss enables multi-class SVM style training.

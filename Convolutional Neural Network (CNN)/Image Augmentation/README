# Image Augmentation with TensorFlow/Keras

Overview

This project demonstrates how to perform image augmentation using TensorFlow/Keras' ImageDataGenerator.  
Image augmentation artificially expands the training dataset by creating modified versions of images, helping improve the robustness and generalization of deep learning models, especially in image classification tasks.

Features

- Rotation  
- Width and height shifting  
- Shearing  
- Zooming  
- Horizontal flipping  
- Fill modes to handle newly created pixels after transformation  

---

Dataset

- Input: A sample image (e.g., cat.webp)  
- Output: 20 augmented images saved inside the preview/ folder

---

Usage

1. Load your image using load_img()  
2. Convert the image to an array using img_to_array()  
3. Reshape to add batch dimension  
4. Create an ImageDataGenerator instance with desired augmentations  
5. Generate augmented images using .flow() and save them  


Why Use Image Augmentation?

- Increase dataset size without collecting new data  
- Reduce overfitting by introducing variety  
- Improve model's ability to generalize to unseen data
- Makes Model Robust

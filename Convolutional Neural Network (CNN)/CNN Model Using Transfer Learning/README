# 📦 VGG16 Transfer Learning - Image Classification Project

This project demonstrates the use of **Transfer Learning** using the **VGG16** pretrained CNN model from Keras to classify images. It includes **feature extraction**, **fine-tuning**, and performance evaluation.

## 🚀 What is Transfer Learning?

Transfer Learning is a Deep Learning technique where a model trained on one large dataset (like ImageNet) is **repurposed for a different but related task**. Instead of training a model from scratch, we reuse the learned features from a powerful pretrained model.

### 🔧 How it Works:
1. Load a **pretrained CNN** (like VGG16 or ResNet).
2. Freeze its convolutional base (optional).
3. Add your own **custom classifier head**.
4. Train the top layers on your dataset.
5. Optionally, **fine-tune** the top conv layers for better accuracy.

## 🔎 What is Fine-Tuning?

Fine-Tuning means **unfreezing some layers** of the pretrained model and retraining them **along with your custom head** on your dataset.

### 🎯 Why Fine-Tune?
- Helps the model adapt to **specific features** in your dataset.
- Useful when:
  - You have **enough data**.
  - Your new task is **somewhat different** from the original dataset.
- Typically done with a **very small learning rate**.

## 🧠 Why Use Transfer Learning?

✅ Saves Time & Compute  
✅ Prevents Overfitting on small datasets  
✅ Leverages knowledge from huge datasets like ImageNet  
✅ Boosts performance with minimal data

## 🧱 VGG16 Architecture

- Introduced by the **Visual Geometry Group (VGG), Oxford**
- Has **16 layers**: 13 Conv + 3 Dense
- Uses **3x3 filters**, `ReLU` activation, and `MaxPooling`
- Ends with Fully Connected + Softmax layers

### ⚠️ Important:
- We use only the **convolutional base** for feature extraction.
- The classifier is replaced with a **custom dense head** suited to our dataset.
